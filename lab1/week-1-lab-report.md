```
For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:
- Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
- Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
- Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
So that's 9 total examples (3 for each command). For each, include:
- A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
- What the working directory was when the command was run
- A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error.

# CD
# An example of using the command with no arguments.

Working directory when command was run: /home/ <br>
I got this output because I am stating to change the directory to the current directory (since there are no arguments).

# An example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

Working directory when command was run: /home/ <br>
The directory changes only after running the command, and we change the current working directory to the `lecture1` folder which has a path of /home/lecture1/

# An example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

Working directory when command was run: /home/lecture1/ <br>
This does not work because cd changes to a certain directory but a file is not a folder which you can go into, therefore it returns and error.

# LS
# An example of using the command with no arguments.
# An example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
# An example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

# CAT
# An example of using the command with no arguments.
# An example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
# An example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
