> Something that I learned from lab in week 2 that I did not know before was: "What the heck is a secure shell?" I have used a secure shell in a hackathon in the past, but I wasn't aware of the usefulness of the tool until the lab from week 2 where we logged into what I assume to be a partition on the UCSD servers remotely. This week's lab from week 3 further solidified my initial curiousities about the use cases for a secure shell, and it seems very useful for accessing other systems across the internet for something like remote development for example.
